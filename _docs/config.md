title: The config file

### The format

Config files should be YAML.

### Arrays

Prefer multi-line arrays for readability and version control purposes.

Good:

```yml
numbers:
  - one
  - two
  - three
```

Bad:

```yml
numbers: [one, two, three]
```

### Variables

Use the following site-wide variables, where appropriate:

* `title` - the name of the site. Use `title` and not name to match document and page meta.
* `description` - the site's tagline or subtitle

### Baseurl

The site's base URL is [only to be used when the resulting site lives at a subpath of the domain](https://byparker.com/blog/2014/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/). Otherwise, the subpath should be nil, not `/`.

* Example 1: If your site lives at `example.com/blog`, you should have a `baseurl` of `/blog`.
* Example 2: If your site lives at `example.com/`, you should not set a `baseurl`. Not even `/`.

### URL

When your site is intended to be hosted on GitHub Pages, prefer `site.github.url`, to a manually specified `url`. This will save headache if your repository is renamed, you add a CNAME, the project is forked, or if you preview the site locally. To ensure your site renders properly locally, add the following to your site's config (which will be overridden by GitHub Pages):

```yml
github:
  url: http://localhost:4000
```
